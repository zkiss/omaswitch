# OmaSwitch

**A familiar `Alt+Tab` switcher for Omarchy—with live window previews.**

OmaSwitch puts your recently used windows in one fast, keyboard-first overlay. Cycle through them with `Alt+Tab`, type to find one by name, and see a live preview of the highlighted window before you switch.

## Why you will like it

- **Recent windows first.** Uses Hyprland focus history, so the window you want is usually next.
- **Preview before switching.** A live preview follows the selected row instead of showing stale screenshots.
- **Made for the keyboard.** Repeat `Alt+Tab`, search by typing, use arrows or Tab, then press Enter.
- **Stays light.** Uses a second capture stream only during preview handoff—never one stream per row.
- **Fits Omarchy.** Follows your active Omarchy theme and needs no daemon, packages, or privileges.

## See it in action

### Pick the project window without leaving the keyboard

Search or cycle through windows, then confirm with Enter (or release Alt when the compositor forwards the release event).

### Check a live `btop` preview before switching

The preview changes with the selected row, making similarly named windows easy to distinguish.

## Add it to Omarchy

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/piyush97/omaswitch.git --enable
```

It installs in your user configuration and needs no extra package, service, or configuration file.

> Live previews require Hyprland's `hyprland-toplevel-export-v1` protocol. If it is unavailable, switching and search still work; the plugin simply uses its list-only layout.

## Make it your Alt+Tab switcher

Omarchy binds `Alt+Tab` to direct cycling by default. Add this to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` to replace those two bindings:

```lua
hl.unbind("ALT + TAB")
hl.unbind("ALT + SHIFT + TAB")

o.bind("ALT + TAB", "OmaSwitch", "omarchy-shell shell summon piyush.omaswitch '{\"mode\":\"cycle\",\"direction\":1}'")
o.bind("ALT + SHIFT + TAB", "OmaSwitch (reverse)", "omarchy-shell shell summon piyush.omaswitch '{\"mode\":\"cycle\",\"direction\":-1}'")
```

Then reload Hyprland:

```bash
hyprctl reload
hyprctl configerrors
```

`configerrors` should print no errors. If you want to keep Omarchy's default bindings, bind either summon command to another key instead.

## Familiar from the first keypress

| Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt+Tab` | Open the switcher and move to the next recent window |
| `Alt+Shift+Tab` | Open the switcher and move backward |
| `Tab`, `Down`, `Right` | Select the next window |
| `Shift+Tab`, `Up`, `Left` | Select the previous window |
| Type | Filter by title, application, or workspace |
| `Backspace` / `Ctrl+Backspace` | Delete a character / word from the search |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear the search |
| `Enter` or click | Focus the selected window |
| `Esc` or click outside | Close without switching |

To open the searchable picker directly:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell toggle piyush.omaswitch
```

## Keep it current

```bash
omarchy plugin update piyush.omaswitch --yes
```

To disable or remove it:

```bash
omarchy plugin disable piyush.omaswitch
omarchy plugin remove piyush.omaswitch --yes
```

## Troubleshooting

**The plugin is not listed**

```bash
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin list --json
```

**Alt+Tab still directly cycles windows**

Confirm that the original bindings were unbound, then run:

```bash
hyprctl reload
hyprctl configerrors
omarchy menu keybindings --print | grep -E 'ALT \+ TAB|SHIFT ALT \+ TAB|OmaSwitch'
```

**The plugin opens without a preview**

The selected window may not be capturable, or `hyprland-toplevel-export-v1` may be unavailable. This is expected fallback behavior; the list remains fully usable.

**The plugin reports a QML error**

```bash
journalctl --user -f | grep -Ei 'piyush.omaswitch|Switcher.qml|qml.*(error|warning)'
```

## Development

```bash
node test_model.js
omarchy plugin validate .
git diff --check
